## Contributing
We welcome contributions to this project. If you're unsure where to start, see our  [Contributing Guide](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/contributing-to-reaction).

### Developer Certificate of Origin
We use the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) in lieu of a Contributor License Agreement for all contributions to Reaction Commerce open source projects. We request that contributors agree to the terms of the DCO and indicate that agreement by signing-off all commits made to Reaction Commerce projects by adding a line with your name and email address to every Git commit message contributed:
```
Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>
```

You can sign-off your commit automatically with Git by using `git commit -s` if you have your `user.name` and `user.email` set as part of your Git configuration.

We ask that you use your real full name (please no anonymous contributions or pseudonyms) and a real email address. By signing-off your commit you are certifying that you have the right to submit it under the [Apache 2.0 Licensed](./LICENSE).

We use the [Probot DCO GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/dco) to check for DCO sign-offs of every commit.

If you forget to sign-off your commits, the DCO bot will remind you and give you detailed instructions for how to amend your commits to add a signature.
